              Rural areas of India do not have special schools, experts start
              therapy centres and Special schools in big cities, as rural
              parents have poor paying capacity.

              Dholka is a good example, a small taluka city, 35 kilometres away
              from Ahmedabad. It had Aaganvadi centers, Primary Schools,
              Secondary Schools, colleges, hospitals etc in the city and Taluka,
              but there was no Special School for Intellectually challenged
              children. In the year 2010, a young man from Dholka took training
              in special education and started an endeavour. He started “New way
              Education and rural development trust” and “Freedom daycare center
              “. The organization serves about 39 Intellectually challenged
              individuals in rented accommodation, 4 special teachers are
              employed, but paying salary to them is Difficult, as parents don't
              have paying capacity. The trust is trying to provide the best
              possible facilities to the maximum number of intellectually
              challenged individuals in the city of Dholka and the
              interconnected village around it.{" "}
